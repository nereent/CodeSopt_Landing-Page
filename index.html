                <h3>Nursing care</h3>
                <p>Long-Term Care Facilities: Long-term care facilities offer a combination of nursing care, personal
                    care,and rehabilitation services.
                    They cater to individuals who require extended care due to chronic medical
                    conditions,disabilities,or age-related needs.
                </p>
                <p>Nursing care may include wound dressing, Tommy care, intravenous therapy, administering medication,
                    monitoring the general health of the patient, pain control, and other health support.

                <h3>Lose Weight </h3>
                <p>30 per cent focus on exercise:
                    Exercise is a critical component of any weight loss journey. Not only does it help burn calories, it
                    also improves your body’s insulin sensitivity, strengthens muscles, boosts metabolism, and provides
                    numerous cardiovascular benefits, such as enhancing the power output of your heart, lung function,
                    mental health, and overall health benefits. A combination of both aerobic (walking, running,
                    cycling) and anaerobic (strength training, resistance exercises) routines is crucial for
                    well-rounded
                    fitness.

                <h3>Physical therapy</h3>
                <p>Strength Training: Strength training helps seniors improve their mobility so they can resume routine
                    activities, like moving around their home, holding their grandchildren, and lifting groceries. For
                    many seniors, more mobility means more independence.
                    Fall Prevention: Falls often result in head injuries and broken bones for seniors, leading to
                    potentially serious health complications. Physical therapy targets foot pain, muscle weakness, and
                    impaired mobility in seniors to minimize their risk of falling.

                <h3>Gain Weight</h3>
                <p>Balanced Diet: Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Aim to get
                    your calories from whole foods, such as lean protein, complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, fruits,
                    and
                    vegetables.
                    Protein Intake: Protein is essential for building muscle. Include good sources of protein in your
                    diet,such as lean meats, poultry, fish, dairy products, eggs, and plant-based sources like legumes
                    and
                    tofu.
                    Stay Hydrated: Make sure you're drinking enough water to stay hydrated, but avoid excessive water
                    consumption immediately before meals, which can reduce your appetite.
